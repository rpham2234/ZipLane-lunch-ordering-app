# ZipLane-lunch-ordering-app

This is based off of version 0.8.5. During the summer of 2020, I created this app for a startup with my friends in the Thunkable platform. 
Eventually, I learned C# and Xamarin, and ported the app to Xamarin. IDE is Visual Studio 2019. View the Thunkable project here: https://x.thunkable.com/copy/5f348621f7868a1a0587b05b9456b5db

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE:
Go to Models/OrderData.cs, and change public static string Url to the address of your node.js backend.
